	^aka put crud things on the main app

Better File Structure might be something like this:
	why: bc we need to have the crud ops easily called from all components
	so: we need to make a crud component that holds the api calls and makes layout for the rest of the components
		File Structure:
		>src
			>components
				>CRUD Containter: will have all api calls and layouts createForm and tableView
					>CreateForm Component
					>TableView Component
					>Toasts Component??
			>App.js

React.Fragments make it so you can nest child components without unneccessary div tags (aka extra nodes)
	Pro is that these support keys when. Unlike empty tags <></>
